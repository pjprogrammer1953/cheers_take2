cheers_take3

The ruby cheers exercise (see: elizabrock/cheers), this time 5 weeks into learning Ruby, with tests!

Instructions

(What is the class supposed to do)

Specifications

(How does the program work)

Start the program by running ./cheers.rb

The program should ask:

Hello! What is your name?
The user types in their name, for example:

Abby
The program outputs a cheer in the following format:

Give me an... A Give me a... B Give me a... B Give me a... Y Abbyâ€™s just GRAND!
Follow the proper grammatical for a and an. The rule is based on whether the spelling of a letter would begin with a vowel.
Ignore all special characters (i.e. non-word characters) when printing the cheer (e.g. "Give me a...")
Print the user's name out as it was originally input for the "just GRAND" line
If there was no input, ask again until valid input is provided
After printing out the user's cheer, the program asks:

Hey, Abby, what's your birthday? (mm/dd)
The user types in their birthdate

08/25
If there was no input, asks again until valid input is provided
If there was input that couldn't be parsed, the program tries again, but with the prompt:
I couldn't understand that. Could you give that to me in mm/dd format?
The program then outputs the number of days until the user's birthday

Awesome! Your birthday is in 45 days! Happy Birthday in advance!
